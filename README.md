# task_04

My name is Debneel Roy and this is day 3 of my SQL Developer Internship at Elevate Labs.

Today's task was to use aggregate functions and find the sum,count,average of data from the tables created in the previous tasks.

I used the SUM, COUNT, AVG functions on numeric columns and GROUP BY function for specific columns.I also use the HAVING function to filter groups

Thank You.
